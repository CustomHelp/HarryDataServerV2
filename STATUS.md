# HarryDataServer V2 — Implementation Status

*Last updated: 2026-06-19*

Phase numbers follow the execution order used in this project (SPS server was
brought forward; numbering otherwise tracks CLAUDE.md section 18).

---

## Completed Phases

| Phase | Scope | Key files |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Skeleton, DI, config, logging | App.xaml.cs, IniConfigManager, IConfigService/IniConfigService, ILogService/SerilogService, AppConfig, CameraConfig |
| 2 | JSON loader, DB schema, repository, partitioning | JsonTemplateLoader(+models), DatabaseSchema, MySqlRepository, PartitionManager, IDatabaseService/MySqlDatabaseService, MeasurementDefinition, SettingDefinition |
| 3 | Camera TCP client + telegram parser | TelegramParser, TcpCameraClient, CameraTelegramEventArgs, CameraTelegramTypes, ParsedTelegram, Measurement/SettingSample, ICameraService/CameraConnectionService |
| 4 | Measurement pipeline | MeasurementProcessor, MeasurementRowBuilder, MeasurementDefinitionCache, PendingMeasurement |
| 5 | SPS server (7 channels) | TcpSpsServer, ISpsServer, SpsChannel, SpsPartExitData |
| 6 | Settings / Diagnostic / Part-Exit consumers | SettingsProcessor(+SettingDefinitionCache, PendingSetting), DiagnosticProcessor(+CsvFileWriter), PartExitProcessor |
| 7 | Main CSV export | CsvExportService (two-row header, R_/V_ columns) |
| 8 | Image cleanup + DB partition retention | ImageCleanupService |
| 10 | MSA engine | MsaCalculator, MsaService, MsaModels, BaseId, MsaReference(+Loader), MsaConfig |

## Runtime State of Each Service / Processor

| Component | State | Runs on | Queue |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| MySqlDatabaseService | ✅ | startup background Task | — |
| MySqlRepository / PartitionManager | ✅ | caller's Task | — |
| TcpCameraClient ×N | ✅ | one Task per camera (+ keepalive Task) | — |
| MeasurementProcessor | ✅ | dedicated Task | ConcurrentQueue |
| SettingsProcessor | ✅ | dedicated Task | ConcurrentQueue |
| DiagnosticProcessor | ✅ | dedicated Task | ConcurrentQueue (→ CSV, no DB) |
| PartExitProcessor | ✅ | dedicated Task | ConcurrentQueue (→ dmcserial) |
| CsvExportService | ✅ | dedicated Task | ConcurrentQueue (→ main CSV) |
| TcpSpsServer | ✅ | one Task per channel + per client | — |
| ImageCleanupService | ✅ | daily background Task | — |
| MsaService | ✅ | dedicated Task (storage) + per-eval Task | ConcurrentQueue (→ msa_measurements) |

All processors: receive threads only enqueue; per-operation MySqlConnection
(never shared); `ConfigureAwait(false)` on every async I/O op.

## Data Flow (current)

```
Cameras ─Results(Normal)──▶ MeasurementProcessor ─▶ measurements_serial(_trimmer)   [R_/V_ combined into one row]
        ─Results(MSA)─────▶ MsaService(storage)   ─▶ msa_measurements
        ─Settings─────────▶ SettingsProcessor     ─▶ settings
        ─Diagnostic───────▶ DiagnosticProcessor   ─▶ Diagnostic CSV
SPS Ch2 ─PartExit─┬▶ PartExitProcessor  ─▶ dmcserial
                  ├▶ CsvExportService   ─▶ main CSV (all measurements/part, 2-row header)
                  └▶ ImageCleanupService (NG → delete orphaned OK images)
SPS Ch3-7 ─Request;BaseID─▶ MsaService.HandleMsaRequest ─▶ Wait → (eval) → OK/NG
                                                          └▶ msa_results + MSA CSV
Daily ─▶ ImageCleanupService ─▶ delete aged NG/Diag/Golden images + DROP old partitions
```

## MSA engine notes (Phase 10) — assumptions to verify

- **Tolerance (USL−LSL)** is taken from the latest Min/Max in `settings` matched by
  **(camera_id, parameter_set)**. Confirm that parameter_set groups each feature's limits.
- **Reference value xm** (MSA1) and **prepared-error flags** (LimitSample) come from
  `MSA_<module>.json` in `[MSA] ReferencePath`, keyed by measurement **display_name**.
- **Evaluation is poll-based**: first `Request;<BaseID>` returns `Wait` and starts a
  background evaluation; later requests return `OK`/`NG` (or `Error;…`).
- MSA math (Cg, Cgk, %Tolerance, LimitSample) is in `MsaCalculator` and unit-verified.

## Not yet built

- **Phase 9** — Collage generator (triggered on Part Exit = OK; Collage.ini reader).
  Note: the "delete OK images after collage" rule (section 11) lands with Phase 9.
- **Phase 11/12** — WPF UI (per-subsystem UserControls, MSA view).
- **Phase 14** — Companion tools (HarryAnalysis, HarryGraph, HarryCounter, etc.).

## Build & Repo
- `dotnet build HarryDataServer.sln -c Release` → 0 warnings, 0 errors (`net8.0-windows`).
- Branch `main`, pushed to `https://github.com/CustomHelp/HarryDataServerV2`.
